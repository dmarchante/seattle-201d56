#### Announcements!

- ***DEEP BREATH***....... This kind of is a catch-up day for us, and also the one day in the entire course that we leave the most wide-open and with the least amount of new content involved. Why?
    - Adult learning cycle: we need time to reflect and refine our thoughts.
    - The labs on each of the next two days are of much lower intensity than the previous ones this week, and easier to work at on your own, leaving you room to get caught up on the Mon-Wed labs.
    - We can now focus more on refactoring working code, to make it more D.R.Y., and also on improving UI/UX.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 9 of Code 201, students will:

- Have nailed down the functionality of their retail/data/table app, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignments of the previous three days.
- Demonstrate understanding of fundamental CSS layout principles including block, inline, normal, relative, absolute, float, and fixed, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and on a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of advanced CSS layout principles including fixed vs. liquid layouts, as well as grid systems, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and on a quiz administered in Canvas
