# Student Comments from Week 1

### Would you like to describe your past week further?

- Everyday started as if I had to swim across Pacific Ocean, but by the end of the week everything settled down a little bit and I feel like at least I have a life jacket now to help me if I need a break. The Pacific is still there and need to be conquered.
- This week has been challenging but with the help from classmates and TA's. I was able to get my assignments done and learn a lot at the same time.
- Just settling into the routine, the shiny "first day" syndrome is wearing off. It's still a great course, and it was incredibly nice getting the chance to breathe/catch up this week. I feel like I have learned a lot, and that the quick breather is going a long ways toward saving my sanity and helping me catch up/prepare for the pick up in pace next week. 
- Everything feels disjointed and there doesn't seemed to be a common thread that ties all the lectures, lessons, and projects together. My point being, if I had zero prior coding experience when starting 201, I would have failed.
- I am loving the pace of the course and what I am getting this time around.  The CSS was strong this this week for me.
- It was a lot better than the first week. It was more structured and I love the fact that I was able to digest the material.  It was all going at a relatively slower pace, the information being taught was broken down Barney style and it made learning the topics a lot more understandable and retainable.
- Assignments are not opened in timely manner, assignment due dates are incorrect, a bit disorganized. Information is not disseminated (like Power Hour is every Friday, which was a surprise to many of us).
- Sam is a great teacher. The approach is methodical and I really enjoy his perspective on the topics we are going over.

### If you didnâ€™t answer with a 9 or 10, what could we have done differently to earn your referral?

- I think the different experience levels with coding makes the class a little chaotic and disjointed. The ones with no experience need a more traditional teaching approach. But it is sort of 'survival of the fittest'.
- It's really tough to critique due to having prior knowledge with coding, but I do not think this course is designed for beginners whatsoever. I find it odd that on the front page, 201 is stated as needing no prereqs.
- Honestly, it depends on the individual. If the person was an absolute beginner sure I would. If the person had at least a year of actual experience this course may be below their level. Additionally, a set plan for a back-up in the event the instructor gets sick would have been great for the first week. I am very pleased with the instruction for this week since it was more consistent; however, not having a contingency plan for an illness is short-sighted.

### Which aspects of this course did you find least helpful?

- Again, the journals. It's absolutely useless. But rather than complaining too much about it, I propose we should utilize that time with some sort of code wars challenge. Something that rather than sitting and talking about what I learned, actually SHOWING what I learned in a somewhat challenging(but not too challenging) 10-15 min. codewar problem.
- Reading assignments -  the discussions. I don't mind the readings, but I don't find the discussions helpful.
- Partner Power assignments - don't mind attending, but don't know why the assignment is necessary
- I find having to do a journal entry and a reading response every day not a useful learning tool. I don't think I have the time to actually provide thoughtful responses because the bulk of my time is spent on completing the lab assignment. I would welcome it if some of these assignments were spaced out some (instead of every day). For example, maybe we only do one journal entry each week?
- So much emphasis on CSS.
- I understand learning the basics first and then progressing.  So grids / flex boxes etc.  Its just very frustrating to learn one thing and then have people comment OMG its so much easier with these other tools!

### Which aspects of this course did you find most helpful?

- The lectures.  Particularly where Sam goes through the step by step process of doing something, like styling a page.  I find that seeing someone go through it who knows what they are doing helps set a good example for us to work off of, and helped me feel more certain when I had to do one on my own.
- I think the labs have been fine tuned and are really engaging. It's a little bit easier to understand some of the rabbit holes and patterns found in javascript and other languages that we will get to later on.
- A couple of the TAs (2 of them) are very helpful and patient. They have helped me a tremendous amount even when I have the same question more than once.
- This week has been really helpful in understanding CSS and how it actually works in very core level. Understanding this base idea gave me a clear vision.
- The overall structure has been great. Introducing the concepts, experimenting with them, and then solidifying them through code demos and pair programming has been a really beneficial learning cycle. 
- Really enjoying the live coding sessions taking input from different people in the class (via popsicle sticks or otherwise.) I really just want to be exposed to as many people's different ideas and styles and approaches as I can be.

### Do you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns?

- There are so many students and TAs I'm not even sure who all the TAs are. That said, Dana, the one TA I have worked with, has been great.
- I feel like we could use a bit more practice with CSS projects.  I do feel that CSS is given short shrift in the curriculum, but it is expected for us to know how to work with it.
- Im still kind of curious why the resumes we had to make have so much whitespace.
- Projects are good though I think the specs and requirements need to be better hashed out. I think the idea of ambiguity and interpretation is good to have, but subjecting learners early on is a detriment. Ambiguity and vagueness should be reserved for intermediate or advance projects.
- Continue to have that one day for like less course material and more review and reflection time.
- I'm surprised at how fast I'm picking this stuff up especially at the pace this course is.
- Doc Sam's experience in coding and teaching really shines during his lecture/instruction. He is always open to questions or suggestions welcomes discussion in areas we are either unsure of or have a different perspective on. The learning environment he creates is both inviting and safe. Code Fellows really has a valuable asset in Sam. Thank you.
- WHITEBOARDING questions! That would better prepare me for an interview rather than doing journal entries. 
- Lay out plans for the week (i.e pair-programming) as this would allow us to schedule time with our Amazon mentors and/or project managers. 
- When time allows, do those breakout review sessions where students who are comfortable can break for lab, and others can stay behind to get questions answered. 
- Did not like that there was no notice for the partner power hour. Wish we could have information on these in advance so that we can plan our lunch better - especially if we planned to take care of personal stuff.
- Instead of code review of someone's code, going over the previous labs or going over a concept taught in class from scratch. From the perspective of some one who is new to programming, its is very helpful for then to see how coding in done. And even for people with experience or taken this course, they can learn new style or patterns
- I think the CSS demo/assignment was very oddly structured. The book uses a div/id convention, we covered a different one in class. Others are found online with relative ease, for the sake of progressing pass scaffolding consider doing more guided learning like teach the class demo with a less complex wireframe!
- I think our instructor overall has been great, and I enjoy working with Lena as our TA. She has been fantastic.
- A source of frustration with the course has been the lack of transparency regarding the schedule for a given day. It would be very helpful if we could get the schedule for a full week released to us on Sunday or Monday. I know many of us are trying to carve out a little time once a week to go have short meetings with our AWS manager/mentor/team members and right now we are in the dark on which days best work for those. For example, I set a meeting for Friday at 4:30pm with my manager and then I found out that day (around noon) that our lab assignment would be a pair programming exercise. I had to cut short my contribution to the pair programming assignment so I could go meet w/ my manager. If we could get some help with planning our week I think that would be greatly appreciated.
- It's nice having Sam back as our regular instructor. Slow and steady wins the race! (It's really not that slow, tbh, haha.) Also, stability is quite nice. Makes learning much less chaotic, haha.
